# MenstrualGif
R markdown code and a data file to generate an animated gif of estrogen concentrations across a number of people's cycles. All cycles were previously aligned by day of ovulation by a panel of experts working toward consensus, using metabolites of estrogen, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone to decide.

Please note that the code currently works in RStudio, using R version 3.6.2.

The .Rmd and the .csv must be in the same directory to run, and it currently compiles to html and saves a copy of the .gif in the local directory.

*I* think that this code is really cool because it demonstrates how incredibly much variation there is in ovulatory menstrual cycles across individuals.
